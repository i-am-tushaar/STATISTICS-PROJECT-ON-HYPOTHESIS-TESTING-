**A/B Testing & Hypothesis Testing: Impact of Payment Methods on Taxi Fare Revenue**

Objective:
This project's main goal is to run an A/B test to examine the relationship between the total fare and the method of payment. We use Python hypothesis testing and descriptive statistics to extract useful information that can help taxi drivers generate more cash.

Conducted an A/B test using Python to analyze the relationship between payment method (cash vs. credit card) and total fare amount, leveraging descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing.(What I did)

Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and statistical analysis on NYC Taxi Trip records, applying a T-test (T-statistic = 165.5, p-value < 0.05) to evaluate mean fare differences between payment methods.(How I did)

Discovered that credit card payments result in 12% higher fares on average, recommending incentive-based strategies to increase driver revenue by 15%.(What result I got)

## FAQ

#### How did you determine whether payment method affects the total fare amount?

Conducted an A/B test and hypothesis testing using NYC Taxi Trip records. By applying a T-test (T-statistic = 165.5, p-value < 0.05), we found a statistically significant difference in fare amounts between cash and credit card payments, indicating that payment method influences fare pricing.

#### What key recommendations did you make based on the findings?

Since credit card payments resulted in 12% higher fares on average, we recommended incentivizing digital payments by offering discounts or rewards for credit card users. Additionally, implementing seamless and secure card payment options can improve user experience and boost driver revenue by 15%.
