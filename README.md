# STATISTICS-PROJECT-ON-HYPOTHESIS-TESTING-
This project's main goal is to run an A/B test to examine the relationship between the total fare and the method of payment. We use Python hypothesis testing and descriptive statistics to extract useful information that can help taxi drivers generate more cash. 
Problem Statement
In the fast-paced taxi booking sector, making the most of revenue is essential for long-term success and driver happiness. 
Our goal is to use data-driven insights to maximise revenue streams for taxi drivers in order to meet this need. Our research aims to determine whether payment methods have an impact on fare pricing by focusing on the relationship between payment type and fare amount..
Research Question
 
Is there a relationship between total fare amount and payment type? 
Can we nudge customers towards payment methods that generate higher revenue for drivers, without negatively impacting customer experience?
Data Overview
For this analysis, we utilized the comprehensive dataset of NYC Taxi Trip records, used data cleaning and feature engineering procedures to concentrate solely on the relevant columns essential for our investigation.
Relevant columns used for this reseach:
  passenger_count (1 to 5)   payment_type (card or cash)   fare_amount   trip_distance (miles)   duration (minutes)

Null hypothesis: There is no difference in average fare between customers who use credit cards and customers who use cash.\n 
Alternative hypothesis: There is a difference in average fare between customers who use credit cards and customers who use cash
With a T-statistic of 165.5 and a P-value of less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is indeed a significant difference in average fare between the two payment methods.

 Recommendations
 
Encourage customers to pay with credit cards to capitalize on the potential for generating more revenue for taxi cab drivers.
Implement strategies such as offering incentives or discounts for credit card transactions to incentivize customers to choose this payment method.
Provide seamless and secure credit card payment options to enhance customer convenience and encourage adoption of this preferred payment method.
